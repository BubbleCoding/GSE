Personal review of this assignment
I really enjoed this assignment. I always liked to code visual effect and shaders really open up a new world for me.

What did I learn during this assignment
Shaders are weird. I only scratsched the service of shaders so far and would love to continue. Thus I startted reading the book of shaders.
