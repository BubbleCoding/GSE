Personal review of this assignment
This was quite the easy task. I actually think I have created this before during my first year of my bachelors. it took me about an hour maybe 2.

What did I learn during this assignment
Since I already used Gaussian distribution before in coding there wasn't a lot of new discoveries for me. I did appreaciate that I made everything a class/object. That way the code is rather clean and easy to read.
