Personal review of this assignment<br/>
I quite enjoyed this assignment. It was fun to work in Unity again and gain some more confidence in Unity.<br/>
I also really enjoyed working with recursion again and some nice math.</br>

What did I learn during this assignment<br/>
I started this assignment by creating a 2D maze in P5JS https://editor.p5js.org/BubbleCoding/sketches/hAmV-EHlh. <br/>
This had it's pro's and con's. First off it allowed me to code a lot more on the go and as I was on holiday this was prefered. <br/>
Converting the code from p5js to unity did take some time. Some aspects work just a bit differently and created headaches. <br/>
Last important thing I learned is to always, and I mean always, when your working with recursion in Unity or anywhere else really to make a max itterations function somewhere. <br/>
