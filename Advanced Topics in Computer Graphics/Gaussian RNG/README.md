"Gaussian distribution
In statistics, a normal distribution (also known as Gaussian, Gauss, or Laplaceâ€“Gauss distribution) is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable. The general form of its probability density function is{\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {1}{\sigma {\sqrt {2\pi }}}}e^{-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {x-\mu }{\sigma }}\right)^{2}}}"

Personal review of this assignment<br/>
This was quite the easy task. I actually think I have created this before during my first year of my bachelors.

What did I learn during this assignment<br/>
Since I already used Gaussian distribution before in coding there wasnt a lot of new discoveries for me, however one thing I did appreaciate in the way I coded this was that making everything a class/object really keep your code clean.
