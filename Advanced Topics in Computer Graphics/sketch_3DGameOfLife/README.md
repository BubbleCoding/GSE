"Conway's Game of Life
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.[1] 
It is a zero-player game,[2][3] meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. 
One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. 
It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine."

Rules of my game of life:<br/>
if a node has 3 neighbours it becomes/stays alive. If a node has less than 2 or more then 3 neighbours it dies. if a node has 2 neighbours its state doesn't change.

Personal review of this assignment<br/>
Making the 3D game of life was a lot fun. I always like making 3D animation with math. In this case I even came up with the math myself. Figuring out how to get every available neighbour and removing all the wrong neighbours was a lot of fun.

What did I learn during this assignment<br/>
Always double check if you are using the correct variables. At some point I was sure everything was correct, but after a couple hours I found that I used the i from a for loop instead of using that i to get the correct index from a list. After that everything worked.
