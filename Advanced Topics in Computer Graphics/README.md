Course Overview<br/>
This course will dive into specific topics in the broad area of computer graphics.<br/>
While details have not yet been decided, the direction will be procedurally generated content (PCG) and AR/VR.<br/>
The course will require a significant amount of practical work, so programming knowledge is required.<br/>
We will implement common algorithms for PCG in computer games and put them to use in a VR environment.<br/>

Assignments:<br/>
3D Game of Life<br/>
